## About me 
I am a **PhD student** at **EPFL**, Lausanne, Switzerland since September 2021. I was an EDIC Fellow during my first year.
I am interested in **post quantum cryptography** and **digital signatures**. 
I am working in the [LASEC](https://lasec.epfl.ch) lab supervised by [Pr. Serge Vaudenay](https://lasec.epfl.ch/people/vaudenay/) and [Pr. Christophe Petit](https://christophe.petit.web.ulb.be) (ULB). <br>

### Recent updates
- I just started, on June 1st 2025 an internship at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/) in Stuttgart, Germany until August, 31st 2025. 
- I did a 6 months research visit to [Pr. Steven Galbraith](https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~sgal018/) at the University of Auckland, New Zealand from mid-July 2024 to mid-January 2025, thanks to an EPFL DocMobility grant.

### Previously

I completed a **Bachelor in Mathematics** at the **University of Geneva** (2016-2019), with an exchange semester at the **University of Toronto** during my 3rd year.

I then obtained a **MASt in Pure Mathematics** at the **University of Cambridge** (2019-2020), more commonly known as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, specializing in Number Theory. 

I went on with another **Master in Mathematics and Computer Science** at the **University of Geneva** (2020-2021), with a focus on cryptography and security.
