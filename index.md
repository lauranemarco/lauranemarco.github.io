## About me 
I am a **PhD student** at **EPFL**, Lausanne, Switzerland. I was an EDIC Fellow during my first year.
I am interested in **post quantum cryptography** and **digital signatures**. 
I am working in the LASEC lab under the supervision of [Pr. Serge Vaudenay](https://lasec.epfl.ch/people/vaudenay/). 

### Previously

I completed a **Bachelor in Mathematics** at the **University of Geneva** (2016-2019), with an exchange semester at the **University of Toronto** during my 3rd year.
I then obtained a **MASt in Pure Mathematics** at the **University of Cambridge** (2019-2020), more commonly known as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, specializing in Number Theory. 
I went on with another **Master in Mathematics and Computer Science** at the **University of Geneva** (2020-2021), with a focus on cryptography and security.

### What you can find here 
In [Projects](https://lauranemarco.github.io/projects/), you can find my past and current research projects. 

In [Talks & Reviews](https://lauranemarco.github.io/talksreviews), you can find a list of the academic and non-academic talks I have given, and the events I have been a reviewer for.

### Random 
If you are reading cryptography-related papers and have questions about it, check out [AskCrypto](https://askcryp.to), a great initiative for sharing knowledge about cryptography launched by my colleague [Abdullah Talayhan](https://www.abdullahtalayhan.com).

If you are applying to a PhD in Computer Science at EPFL, and would like to get feedback from Phd students on application material, have a look [here](https://epic-guide.github.io/ramp) (any CS related subject) or reach out via mail (cryptography related only). 

I launched the **Women in IC initiative** of the PHD in Computer Science association of EPFL ([EPIC](http://epic.epfl.ch/)). [Here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/5?cid=ZXBmbC5lcGljQGdtYWlsLmNvbQ) is our events calendar !
