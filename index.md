## About me 
I am currently a 1st year PhD student at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, currently under the EDIC fellowship. 
I am interested in **post quantum cryptography** and **digital signatures**. 
I am currently working in the LASEC lab under the supervision of Pr. Serge Vaudenay. 

### Previously

I completed a Bachelor in Mathematics at the Univeristy of Geneva (2016-2019, with an exchange semester at the University of Toronto during my 3rd year.
I then obtained a MASt in Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge (2019-2020), more commonly know as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, specializing in Number Theory. 
I went on with another master in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Geneva (2020-2021), with a focus in cryptography and security.
