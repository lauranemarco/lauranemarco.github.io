## About me 
I am a **1st year PhD student** at **EPFL**, Lausanne, Switzerland, currently under the EDIC fellowship. 
I am interested in **post quantum cryptography** and **digital signatures**. 
I am working in the LASEC lab under the supervision of Pr. Serge Vaudenay. 

### Previously

I completed a **Bachelor in Mathematics** at the **University of Geneva** (2016-2019), with an exchange semester at the **University of Toronto** during my 3rd year.
I then obtained a **MASt in Pure Mathematics** at the **University of Cambridge** (2019-2020), more commonly known as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, specializing in Number Theory. 
I went on with another **Master in Mathematics and Computer Science** at the **University of Geneva** (2020-2021), with a focus on cryptography and security.

### What you can find here 
In [Projects](https://lauranemarco.github.io/projects/), you can find my past and current research projects. 

In [Blog](https://lauranemarco.github.io/blog/), I plan to write more informal posts on my research as well as topics I am interested in. This is more aimed at a general audience.
