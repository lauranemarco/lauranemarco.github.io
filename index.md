## About me 
I am a **PhD student** at **EPFL**, Lausanne, Switzerland. I was an EDIC Fellow during my first year.
I am interested in **post quantum cryptography** and **digital signatures**. 
I am working in the [LASEC](https://lasec.epfl.ch) lab supervised by [Pr. Serge Vaudenay](https://lasec.epfl.ch/people/vaudenay/) and [Pr. Christophe Petit](https://christophe.petit.web.ulb.be) (ULB). 

### Previously

I completed a **Bachelor in Mathematics** at the **University of Geneva** (2016-2019), with an exchange semester at the **University of Toronto** during my 3rd year.

I then obtained a **MASt in Pure Mathematics** at the **University of Cambridge** (2019-2020), more commonly known as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, specializing in Number Theory. 

I went on with another **Master in Mathematics and Computer Science** at the **University of Geneva** (2020-2021), with a focus on cryptography and security.


### Random 
I contribute to the organization of the **Women in Cryptography seminar**. Check it out [here](https://www.womenincryptography.com/seminar/).

If you are applying to a PhD in Computer Science at EPFL, and would like to get feedback from Phd students on application material, check out our **RAMP program** [here](https://epic-guide.github.io/ramp). I'm proud of supporting this program by being a RAMP mentor. 

If you are reading cryptography-related papers and have questions about it, check out [AskCrypto](https://askcryp.to), a great initiative for sharing knowledge about cryptography launched by my colleague [Abdullah Talayhan](https://www.abdullahtalayhan.com).
